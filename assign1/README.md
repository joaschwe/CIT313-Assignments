The original source code provided doesn't work. It is necessary to debug the site to make it function correctly. There are more than 5 errors, but less than 15.

Source code can be downloaded from GitHub (you must be logged in):  https://github.com/crobertdillon/CIT313_Spring2018/tree/master/Debug-Exercise-master  (Feel free to clone or fork but the easiest for this assignment is to choose 'Download Zip' in the lower right hand corner)
