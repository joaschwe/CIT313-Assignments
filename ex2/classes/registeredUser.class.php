/**INSTRUCTIONS
CREATE SUBCLASSES
Now create two more classes--RegisteredUser & Admin--, each in their own files, which are subclasses of the User class.
A registered user is of user_type 1.
An admin user is of user type 2
 *
 * The constructor method of the classes should...
 * accept two parameters:  user_level and user_id
 * set the default value of each class.

Both classes should...
 * call their parentâ€™s constructor method
 * set the user id in the constructor method
